Updated Final Project Memo

1)	PROGRESS THUS FAR

--Downloaded the CSV files from Las Vegas. The data has been changed to come from Las Vegas instead of SF. 

--Writing a python script to parse the CSV files and create a CSV file with our data with relevant data. 
--Take all data, organize it, put it in one file
--what attributes will be worthwhile?
a.	Name, Address, latitude and longitude, Inspection Grade, Demerits, Number of Stars on Yelp, Price range, specific reviews

2) ROADBLOCKS 

--A challenge will be parsing the csv on one side and the Json on the other. 
--We have data thatâ€™s somewhat organized but from the website it looks like they took a bunch of SQL data and dumped it into CSV files. 


3)	MOCKUP 
Aesthetics: how the prototype would look. 
a.	Text: flask practice
